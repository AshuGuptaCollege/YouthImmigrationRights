            <li><b>Don’t talk about your immigration status</b>
            <br/>If school officials or immigration ask about you or your family, you
            do not have to answer them.  Don’t lie.  You do not have to answer questions
            about where you were born or where you are from, but do not give false information
             about your identity or status or claim that you are a U.S. citizen if you are not.
            </li>
            <li><b>Don’t give permission to search your things</b>
            <br/> Your school might give immigration permission to search your locker.
             This is a policy choice made by your school and you can’t stop them.
            </li>
            <li><b>Go to school</b>
            <br/>You have a right to go to school even if you are undocumented.
             Stay in School.  Immigration is not supposed to come to your school.
