            <li><b>You do not have to let an agent into your home</b>
            <br/> The only reason you should let an ICE agent into your home is
            if the agent has a warrant signed by a judge or magistrate.
            </li>
            <li><b>You have a right to remain silent - but you cannot lie if you speak</b></li>
            <li><b>You can interpret for your family if they need you to</b>
            <br/>Your non-English speaking family has a right to be spoken to /
            interacted with in their best language.
            </li>
            <li><b>You do not have to talk about yourself if you are interpreting</b>
            <br/> If the ICE agent has a signed warrant to talk to one of your family
             members, you can interpret for them without being required to answer any
            personal questions about yourself.
