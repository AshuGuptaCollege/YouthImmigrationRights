            <li><b>Don’t let immigration into your home unless they have a warrant</b>
            <br/> The only reason you should let immigration into your home is if they have a warrant signed by a judge.
            </li>
            <li><b>Stay silent but don’t lie if you speak</b></li>
            <li><b>Interpret for your family</b>
            <br/>Your non-English speaking family has a right to be spoken to in their best language.
             You can interpret for your non-English speaking family members.  Don’t talk about yourself
              if you are interpreting.  If immigration has a signed warrant to talk to one of your
              family members, you can interpret for them without being required to answer any personal
               questions about yourself.
            </li>
            <li><b>Know you can’t be deported as a US citizen</b>
            <br/>If you are a citizen of the United States, you cannot be deported -
            even if other people in your household don’t have status.
