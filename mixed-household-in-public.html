        <li><b>Say NO to a search of your things</b>
        <br/>Unless immigration has a warrant signed by a judge or is arresting you,
         you do not have to give permission for immigration to search you.
         If immigration tries to search you without permission, do not fight them.
        </li>
        <li><b>Stay silent but donâ€™t lie if you speak</b>
        <br/>You have a right to remain silent if immigration or police come to speak
        with you in public.  You do not have to answer questions about where you were
         born or where you are from, but do not give false information about your
         identity or status or claim that you are a U.S. citizen if you are not.
        </li>
        <li><b>Ask if you are free to leave</b>
        <br/>You are free to leave unless immigration has a warrant
        signed by a judge or immigration is arresting.
        </li>
        <li><b>Speak in your best language with your friends and family</b>
        <br/>If immigration asks you personal questions because of what
        language you are using, you are not required to answer them.
        </li>
        <li><b>Record video or take pictures in public</b>
          <br/>You are free to record video or take pictures in public places,
          but you are not allowed to interfere with police or immigration doing their job.
