        <li><b>Stay Silent</b>
        <br/>You can refuse to discuss your immigration status when arrested and
        can refuse interviews with immigration agents while in police custody.
        </li>
        <li><b>Don’t Sign Anything Before Talking to a Lawyer</b>
        <br/>You have a right to speak to a lawyer but not for free.
        You may receive a free lawyer if you’ve been arrested by police.
        You will need to provide your own lawyer if you’ve been detained by immigration.
        </li>
        <li><b>Don’t Run and Don’t Resist Arrest</b>
        <br/>If you visit a friend in detention,
        you might be detained if you don’t have immigration status.
        </li>
        <li><b>Call Your Lawyer or Your Family</b>
        <br/>You can contact your lawyer or your family. You should memorize at least one phone number.
       </li>
       <li><b>Talk to an Immigration Judge</b>
       <br/>You will usually see a judge before being deported unless you are arrested or detained near the border.  You have a right to a court interpreter
       in deportation proceedings.  You cannot be deported if you are a US Citizen.
